basics:
  - "project" is a grouping of templates
  - tool > template editor
  - adding tags to templates makes them searchable and referable later
  - regular templates:
      - supports IOS-XE, IOS-XR, and NX-OS
      - validation checks for syntax errors or blacklisted commands
      - often small, perform one action (hostname, ntp, ospf, etc)
  - composite template:
      - composition of two or more regular templates
      - combine small regular template to form a full config
      - "template editor" lets you sequence the component templates
  - can "simulate" templates by rendering them with mock data to check
  - saving a template adds it to a version control system
  - templates are assigned to profiles
    1. routing and NFV
    2. switching: specify devices and device type
    3. wireless: specify SSIDs
  - then assign sites?
  - then "provision" and identify devices from inventory
  - can be deployed now or scheduled for later
